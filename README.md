Drustcraft is a Minecraft network that enables players to participate in an open MMORPG, creating their own cities, quests, shops, NPCs and participanting in world events, dungeons and raids.

## What is Drustcraft?
Drustcraft is a Minecraft network that enables players to participate in an open MMORPG, supporting both Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a free-play, safe and open world for players to explore and expand on, directing the seasonal storyline towards their work. There is even options for organisations to join in and create their own townships, quests and engagements!

**Please note, this project is still a work in progress. Expect bugs!**

#### Currently supporting Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.220 and Minecraft Java v1.16.5.
